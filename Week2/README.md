Running this would be pretty simple

Embed your API_KEY in the script source at the very top, and open preview

Everything is hardcoded in this test, so API Key is not secure at all. To use the API_KEY as an enviornment variable I will work to make this in a style similar to the implementation found in Week1 Folder
