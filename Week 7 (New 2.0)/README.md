# Whats NEW!

Autocomplete from chris
TextSearch added from my Week 5 file
Search query input box for text search
Sort method dropdown box
all the places are stored in an array without duplicates and sorted

# CHECK OUT:
places_array by the end of the show_places function holds all the places that has been sorted. This is what is being console logged. 

# Project Setup Instructions

Before running the project, make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install express
npm install dotenv
npm install nodemon
```
make a local .env file and put your own API key

it should look like the .env_sample file

then run:
```bash
nodemon server.js
```
*DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR .env FILE TO GITHUB*

Instead, make a .gitignore file and list your .env file in it (look at my .gitignore for reference)
